# Guide

This page will be updated as common issues are reported by users.

If you encounter a problem, please check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vijaysingh2219/build-elevate/issues) or open a new discussion. We will add solutions for frequently reported problems here to help the community.

> **Note:** If you see the same error as others, let us know! The more reports we get, the faster we can improve this guide.

## Command Not Found

If you get a "command not found" error:

```bash
# For pnpm users, try:
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm dlx build-elevate@latest init

# For npm users:
npx build-elevate@latest init

# For bun users:
bunx build-elevate@latest init
```

## Installation Fails

If the installation fails:

1. **Check your Node.js version**

```bash
   node --version  # Must be v20 or higher
```

2. **Clear package manager cache**

```bash tab="pnpm"
   pnpm store prune
```

```bash tab="npm"
   npm cache clean --force
```

3. **Try with verbose logging**

```bash
   pnpm dlx build-elevate@latest init --verbose
```

## Port Already in Use

If you see an error like "Port 3000 is already in use":

```bash tab="Linux/Mac"
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use a different port
PORT=3001 pnpm dev --filter=web
```

```bash tab="Windows"
# Find what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill the process
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or use a different port
set PORT=3001 && pnpm dev --filter=web
```

## Authentication Not Working

If you can't sign in:

1. **Verify `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is the same** in `apps/api/.env.local` and `apps/web/.env.local`
2. **Check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`** in `apps/api/.env.local` matches your web app URL
3. **Clear cookies** and try again
