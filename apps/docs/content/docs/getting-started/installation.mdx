# Installation

Get your build-elevate project up and running in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

<Cards>
  <Card icon={<CheckCircle />} title="Node.js 20+">
    Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
  </Card>
  <Card icon={<CheckCircle />} title="pnpm (Recommended)">
    Fast, disk space efficient package manager
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Verify Your Installation

Check that Node.js is installed correctly:

```bash
node --version
# Should output: v20.x.x or higher
```

<Callout type="info">
  While pnpm is recommended for its speed and efficiency, you can also use npm
  or bun. The CLI will detect your preferred package manager during setup.
</Callout>

## Create Your Project

### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)

Run the following command and follow the prompts:

```npm
pnpm dlx build-elevate@latest init
```

You'll be asked:

1. **Project name** - Enter your project name (e.g., `my-saas-app`)
2. **Package manager** - Choose between pnpm, npm, or bun
3. **Docker** - Opt to include Docker configuration
4. **Prisma Studio** - Choose to include Prisma Studio for database management

<Callout type="success">
  The CLI will scaffold your entire project structure and install all
  dependencies. This usually takes 2-3 minutes.
</Callout>

### Option 2: Direct Installation

You can also specify options directly:

```bash
pnpm dlx build-elevate@latest init my-project -y
```

### What Gets Created?

After running the command, you'll have this structure:

```
my-project/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/              # Next.js frontend
│   ├── api/              # Express backend
│   ├── email/            # Email templates
│   └── studio/           # Database UI
├── packages/
│   ├── auth/             # Authentication logic
│   ├── db/               # Prisma & database
│   ├── ui/               # React components
│   ├── email/            # Email templates
│   ├── utils/            # Shared utilities
│   └── rate-limit/       # API rate limiting
├── package.json
├── turbo.json
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

## Post-Installation Steps
