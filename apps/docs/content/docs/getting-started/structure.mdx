description: Understanding the build-elevate monorepo architecture and file organization
---

import { FolderTree, Package, Layers, Code2 } from "lucide-react";

Understanding how the project is organized will help you navigate the codebase and know where to add your features.

## Monorepo Architecture

We use **Turborepo** to manage multiple applications and packages in a single repository. This architecture provides:

- **Code Sharing**: Shared packages used across multiple apps
- **Fast Builds**: Intelligent caching and parallel execution
- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript configurations
- **Unified Tooling**: Consistent linting, formatting, and testing

<Callout type="info">
  Think of it as multiple projects (web app, API, packages) living together,
  sharing code, and building faster together.
</Callout>

## Root Directory

```
build-elevate/
├── apps/                    # Applications (user-facing)
├── packages/                # Shared packages (internal libraries)
├── .github/                 # GitHub Actions workflows
├── .husky/                  # Git hooks
├── node_modules/            # Dependencies
├── package.json             # Root package configuration
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml      # pnpm workspace configuration
├── turbo.json               # Turborepo pipeline configuration
├── tsconfig.json            # Root TypeScript configuration
├── eslint.config.js         # ESLint configuration
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

### Key Root Files

| File                  | Purpose                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `package.json`        | Root scripts and workspace dependencies         |
| `turbo.json`          | Build pipeline, caching, and task dependencies  |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Defines which folders are part of the workspace |
| `tsconfig.json`       | Base TypeScript configuration for all packages  |
| `eslint.config.js`    | Shared ESLint rules for all workspaces          |

## Applications (`apps/`)

Applications are the user-facing parts of your project. Each app can be deployed independently.

```
apps/
├── web/                     # Next.js frontend application
├── api/                     # Express backend server
├── email/                   # Email template development
└── studio/                  # Prisma Studio wrapper
```

<Callout type="info">
  Find more details about each application in the
  [Applications](../applications) section.
</Callout>

## Packages (`packages/`)

Packages are internal libraries shared across applications. They provide reusable code and maintain consistency.

```
packages/
├── auth/                   # Authentication logic
├── db/                     # Database schema and client
├── ui/                     # React component library
├── email/                  # Email templates and utilities
├── utils/                  # Shared utilities
├── rate-limit/             # Rate limiting utilities
├── eslint-config/          # Shared ESLint configuration
├── prettier-config/        # Shared Prettier configuration
├── typescript-config/      # Shared TypeScript configs
└── jest-presets/           # Testing configuration
```

<Callout type="info">
  Find more details about each package in the [Packages](../packages) section.
</Callout>

## Build Output

When you run `pnpm build`, output files go to:

```
apps/web/.next/             # Next.js build output
apps/api/dist/              # Express build output
packages/*/dist/            # Package build outputs
node_modules/.cache/turbo/  # Turborepo cache
```

<Callout type="info">
  Turborepo caches build outputs to speed up subsequent builds. Run `pnpm clean`
  to clear all caches.
</Callout>
