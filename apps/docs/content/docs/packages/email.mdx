## Overview

`@workspace/email` provides email features for the monorepo, including:

- Transactional email templates built with [React Email](https://react.email/)
- Email sending via [Resend](https://resend.com/)
- Shared configuration, schemas, and types

## Usage

Import and use email utilities in your apps:

```ts
import { sendEmail, getTemplate } from "@workspace/email";

// Send an email
await sendEmail({
  to: "user@example.com",
  subject: "Welcome!",
  react: getTemplate("verify-email").render({
    name: "User",
    email: "user@example.com",
    verificationUrl: "https://example.com/verify",
  }),
});
```

## Features

- **Predefined Templates**: Verification, password reset, change email
- **Type-safe Schemas**: Zod-validated email content
- **Simple API**: `sendEmail` for sending, `getTemplate` for rendering
- **React Components**: Modular, customizable email UIs

## Setup

1. Configure Resend API keys in your environment variables (`RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_EMAIL_FROM`).
2. Customize templates in `packages/email/src/templates/` as needed.

## Templates

The following templates are included:

- **Verification Email**: For account confirmation
- **Change Email**: For email address changes
- **Reset Password**: For password recovery

Templates use shared React components for consistent design. See `packages/email/src/templates/` and `packages/email/src/components/` for details.
