## Overview

`@workspace/ui` is a shared UI component library built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), providing reusable, themeable React components for all apps in the monorepo.

## Usage

To use a component in your app:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@workspace/ui/components/button";
```

## Adding Components

To add new components from shadcn/ui:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -c apps/web
```

This will place the component in `packages/ui/src/components/`.

## Tailwind Setup

Tailwind CSS is preconfigured. Use `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` from the UI package for consistent styling.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: Button, Alert, Card, Dialog, Tooltip, and more
- **Themeable**: Built-in support for dark mode and custom themes
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support
- **Utility Functions**: Includes helpers like `cn()` for class merging
