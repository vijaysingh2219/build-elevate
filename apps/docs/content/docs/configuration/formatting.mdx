description: Linting and formatting configuration for the monorepo using ESLint and Prettier.
---

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain code quality and consistency across the monorepo.

## Benefits

- Enforces coding standards
- Catches potential errors early
- Ensures consistent code style
- Integrates with IDEs for real-time feedback
- Works seamlessly with Git hooks for pre-commit checks

## Usage

The formtter and linter are preconfigured for all packages and apps in the monorepo. To use them:

- `pnpm lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- `pnpm format`: Runs Prettier to format code according to defined style rules.
