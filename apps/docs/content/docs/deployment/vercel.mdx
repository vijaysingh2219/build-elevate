## Deployment

This guide covers deploying the monorepo to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a popular platform for hosting Next.js applications.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account
- Access to the monorepo

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Import the Repository**
   - Log in to your Vercel account.
   - Click on "New Project" and select "Import Git Repository".
   - Connect your Git provider and select the monorepo.

2. **Configure Project Settings**
   - For each application (e.g., `web`), create a separate Vercel project.
   - Set the root directory for each project:
     - For the Web app, set the root to `apps/web`.
   - Configure the build and output settings

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - In the Vercel dashboard, navigate to the "Settings" tab of your project
   - Add the necessary environment variables as defined in `.env` files (see [more](../configuration/environment-variables)).

4. **Deploy the Application**
   - Once everything is configured, click "Deploy".
   - Vercel will build and deploy your application. You can monitor the deployment process in the dashboard.

5. **Post-Deployment**
   - After deployment, verify that the application is running correctly by visiting the provided Vercel URL.

## Additional Tips

- Use Vercel's preview deployments for testing changes before going live.
- Monitor performance and logs through the Vercel dashboard.
- Set up custom domains in the Vercel settings for production use.
